     * odd but it also works, at least in Markdown Preview,
     * and it is a plausible edge case.

     * Numbering in front of a heading just displays a bullet,

     * Also note that there is a limit on white space before
     * a heading, as four lines equals raw monospace text.

     * it would interfere with bullets at level 3+.
