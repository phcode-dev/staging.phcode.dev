 * Brackets Colors
 *
 * These are general purpose colors that can be used in defining
 * themes or UI elements. you can override these by overriding the :root{} element
 * with your own variable definitions in the theme css.
 * All brackets color variable names (that refer to an actual color)
 * are prefixed with "bc-" for "brackets". This is to avoid confusion
 * with system and css color names. (We define our own colors because system
 * colors are ugly.)
