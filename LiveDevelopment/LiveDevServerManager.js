/**
 * LiveDevServerManager Overview:
 *
 * The LiveDevServerManager allows extensions to register to be Live Development
 * servers. Servers are queried for their ability to serve a page in
 * order of descending priority by way their canServe methods.
 *
 * NOTE: This API is currently experimental and intented to be internal-only.
 * It is very likely that it will be changed in the near future and/or
 * removed entirely.
 *
 *   `LiveDevServerManager.getServer(localPath)`
 *
 * Returns highest priority server (BaseServer) that can serve the local file.
 *
 * A Live Development server must implement the BaseServer API. See
 * LiveDevelopment/Servers/BaseServer base class.
